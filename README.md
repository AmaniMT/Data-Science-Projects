# Data Science Projects

This repository showcases my personal exploration of the exciting world of data science. Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've undertaken to learn and experiment with various techniques for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## [Image Processing with OpenCV](https://github.com/AmaniMT/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Image%20Processing%20with%20OpenCV/Image%20Processing%20with%20OpenCV.ipynb)

This project showcases various image processing techniques using OpenCV in Python. It covers essentials such as: 
- Explore essential operations like loading, displaying, and saving images.
- Correct channel orders to ensure accurate color representation.
- Manipulate image channels, crop images, and draw shapes.
- Modify specific pixels to achieve desired effects.
- Analyze histograms for color distribution insights.
- Adjust brightness and contrast for image enhancement.
- Perform thresholding for image segmentation tasks.
- Scale images using different interpolation techniques.
- Apply kernel-based filters for tasks like sharpening, blurring, and edge detection.


## [California Housing Prices Prediction](https://github.com/AmaniMT/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/California%20Housing%20Prices%20Prediction/California%20Housing%20Prices%20Prediction.ipynb)
In this project, inspired by Geron Aurelien's book 'Hands-On Machine Learning With Scikit-Learn, Keras, And Tensorflow', I delved into the Kaggle California Housing Prices Prediction dataset. After preprocessing and splitting the data, I compared three models: linear regression, decision tree, and random forests. Through rigorous evaluation, I identified the optimal model for accurately predicting house prices.
