# Data Science Projects

This repository showcases my personal exploration of the exciting world of data science. Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've undertaken to learn and experiment with various techniques for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.


## California Housing Prices Prediction
In this project, inspired by Geron Aurelien's book 'Hands-On Machine Learning With Scikit-Learn, Keras, And Tensorflow', I delved into the Kaggle California Housing Prices Prediction dataset. After preprocessing and splitting the data, I compared three models: linear regression, decision tree, and random forests. Through rigorous evaluation, I identified the optimal model for accurately predicting house prices.
